Delivered an **invited talk** on *An Introduction to Non-Commutative Functions and Their Difference-Differential Calculus* on **22nd May 2025**, organized by the **Department of Mathematics, Sikkim University**.

### Abstract
This talk introduced the foundational ideas in **non-commutative function theory**, highlighting how classical calculus concepts extend to the non-commutative setting. The focus was on the role of difference-differential operators in analyzing free (non-commutative) functions and their applications in operator theory.

### Key Points Covered
- Motivation for non-commutative variables and free analysis
- Definition and examples of non-commutative functions
- Difference-differential calculus and non-commutative derivatives
- Applications in operator algebras and system theory
