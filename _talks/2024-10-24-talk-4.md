Delivered a talk titled **"Introduction to Nets and Filters in Topology"** as part of the **Ph.D. Seminar Series** organized by the **Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi** in **2024**.

### Overview
The talk explored the generalization of sequences through **nets** and **filters**, and their role in capturing convergence and continuity in topological spaces where sequential notions are insufficient.

### Topics Covered
- Motivation behind nets and filters
- Directed sets and their role in topology
- Convergence via nets and filters
- Applications in characterizing compactness and continuity

This seminar was aimed at research scholars working in topology, analysis, and related areas.
