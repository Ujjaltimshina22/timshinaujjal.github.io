Delivered an invited lecture on **"Transformation Geometry: The Complete Symmetries of Regular Shapes"** during the **INMO Training Camp** held at **SMIT Sikkim**, funded by **HBCSE, TIFR**, in **2024**.

### Overview
The lecture introduced participants to the idea of **geometrical transformations** and **symmetry groups**, focusing on their role in understanding the structure and classification of regular shapes.

This session was designed for Olympiad-level students preparing for national mathematical contests and aimed at bridging abstract algebra with geometric intuition.
