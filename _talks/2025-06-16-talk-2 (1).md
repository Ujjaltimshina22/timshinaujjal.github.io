Delivered a lecture series on the **Geometry of the Möbius Transformation and Inversion** during the **Undergraduate Summer Program in Mathematics**, organized by the **Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi**, from **June 16–28, 2025**.

### Description
The lectures explored the rich geometric structure underlying Möbius transformations, including their classification, fixed points, and action on the extended complex plane. A special focus was placed on **inversion geometry** and its connection to **conformal mappings**.

### Topics Included
- Möbius transformations as compositions of simpler maps
- Fixed points and classification (elliptic, hyperbolic, loxodromic, parabolic)
- Geometry of inversion and the extended complex plane
- Circles, lines, and their invariance under Möbius maps
- Applications in complex analysis and conformal geometry
