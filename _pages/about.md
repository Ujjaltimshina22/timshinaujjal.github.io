Hello! Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Ujjal Timshina, and I am currently a PhD scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/phd/current), working under the supervision of [Dr. Prahllad Deb](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/prahllad). I joined IIIT Delhi after being awarded the prestigious [INSPIRE Research Fellowship](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Sikkim University](https://cus.ac.in/), a central university established by an Act of Parliament, Government of India. I graduated with a CGPA of 9.81 and received the University Gold Medal. My master's thesis, titled *“Nets and Filters in Topology”*, was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Namita Behera](https://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools-e/physical-sciences/mathematics-dept/dr-namita-behera-2). I completed my undergraduate studies at [Nar Bahadur Bhandari Government College](https://nbbgc.org/), affiliated with Sikkim University.

My research interests lie in **functional analysis**, with a focus on the **Cowen–Douglas theory of operators** and its interplay with **complex geometry** and **non-commutative function theory**. 

I have completed doctoral-level coursework in **Functional Analysis**, **Complex Analysis**, **Several Complex Variables**, and **Introduction to Non-commutative Function Theory**. I am also broadly interested in **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**, **Spectral Theory**, **Representation Theory**, **Differential Geometry**, and **Algebraic Topology**.

For me, research is a quiet and deliberate journey into abstraction—an exploration shaped not only by logic but also by creativity, persistence, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty. I view mathematics as both a tool for discovering truth and a language of elegant expression.  

> *We forget, falter, and return —  
not in failure, but in pursuit.  
For in the recursive rhythm of thought,  
understanding does not appear fully formed,  
but emerges — layer by layer — through the patient erosion of illusion.*

Beyond mathematical research, I am deeply committed to teaching, outreach, and academic communication. I have worked as a teaching assistant at IIIT Delhi and served as a guest lecturer at Sikkim Global Technical University. I also actively participate in mathematics Olympiad training camps, workshops, and student mentoring activities.

I am the author of *Beyond Answers: Beauty of Mathematical Questions*, a book reflecting my passion for inquiry-based learning in mathematics. It is available on  
 [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Beyond-Answers-Mathematical-Questions-Thought-ebook/dp/B0CTRY5HRB) and [Notion Press](https://notionpress.com/in/read/beyond-answers-the-beauty-of-mathematical-questions/).

Outside academics, I enjoy writing, web design, and exploring open educational technologies. A selection of my talks and presentations (some with slides) is available [here](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/ujjal-timshina/about).
